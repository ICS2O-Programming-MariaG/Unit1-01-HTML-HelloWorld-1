   <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>My name is Maria and I am a Grade 10 student at Immaculata High School.</p>
    <h2>Writing: My Favourite Pastime</h2>
    <h3>Why I Enjoy Writing</h3>
    <p>I love writing because I can channel my creative side and disappear into a different, fictional world when I am stressed. Writing about things from the perspective of a different character also helps me examine my thought patterns and reactions to everyday problems.</p>
    <h3>My Current Writing Projects</h3>
    <p>Currently, I am working on a story in my spare time. I call it MagiCo and I hope to make it into a published novel someday.</p>
    <h2>My Least Favourite Subject </h2>
    <p>To be completely honest, I do not have a least favourite subject, as I generally enjoy all subjects in school. That being said, I am not a huge fan of classes where memorization and textbook questions are prioritized over true learning and understanding of course material.</p>
