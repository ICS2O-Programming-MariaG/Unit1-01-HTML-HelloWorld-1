    <h3 style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:20%">Why I Enjoy Writing</h3>
    <p style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:20%">I love writing because I can channel my creative side and disappear into a different, fictional world when I am stressed. Writing about things from the perspective of a different character also helps me examine my thought patterns and reactions to everyday problems.</p>
    <h3 style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:20%">My Current Writing Projects</h3>
    <p style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:20%">Currently, I am working on a story in my spare time. I call it MagiCo and I hope to make it into a published novel someday.</p>

    <center><h2>My Least Favourite Subject </h2></center>
    <p style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:20%">To be completely honest, I do not have a least favourite subject, as I generally enjoy all subjects in school. That being said, I am not a huge fan of classes where memorization and textbook questions are prioritized over true learning and understanding of course material.</p>
